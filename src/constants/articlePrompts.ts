Exclude greetings, signatures, and hashtags. Omit metadata; provide only the ready-to-send message. Craft a comment that's contextually appropriate and ready for immediate use.

Words and phrases to avoid: Avoid corporate jargon, idioms, and exaggerations. Make the voice and style conversational and concise unless otherwise specified.

- Do not use hashtags, even if they are present in the article.
- Do not include anything that might seem offensive, unprofessional, or inappropriate for LinkedIn.
